# Multiple-Linear-Regression--with-plotting-
Introduction to building models in Python, and what better place to start than one of the very basic models, linear regression? Linear regression is a statistical model that examines the linear relationship between two (Simple Linear Regression ) or more (Multiple Linear Regression) variables — a dependent variable and independent variable(s). Linear relationship basically means that when one (or more) independent variables increases (or decreases), the dependent variable increases (or decreases) too.In most cases, we will have more than one independent variable — we’ll have multiple variables; it can be as little as two independent variables and up to hundreds (or theoretically even thousands) of variables. In those cases we will use a Multiple Linear Regression model (MLR).
